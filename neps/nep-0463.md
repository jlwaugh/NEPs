  Title: Decentralized Autonomous Organization Standard
  Author: DAO Builders Group
  Status: Draft

  Type: Standards

```

## Summary

A standard interface to support decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that enable proposals with governance.

## Motivation

There is a need for **interoperable DAO systems** on NEAR and other blockchains.

Essentially, this NEP requests feedback from the Contract Standards Working Group.

### Benefits:

* greater accessibility
* better coordination
* easier development

#### *What use cases does it support?*

* *complete display of “My DAOs” in wallets and on-chain profiles*
* *composability across platforms with a common ABI for any `DAO`*
* *cohesive, yet decentralized governance by NEAR communities*

DAO contract standards help builders create new DAOs that integrate with existing DAOs.

## Rationale

[Sputnik DAOs](https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-contract) represent a widely used contract system on NEAR, and the code has been thoroughly tested and reviewed by the community. Our hope is to improve accessibility of that robust open-source product by formally introducing a compatible standard.

Considering the principles of [EIP-4824](https://daostar.one/EIP), let's assume DAOs have at least two primitives:

1. **MEMBERSHIP** is defined by a set of addresses.
2. **BEHAVIOR** is defined by a set of possible contract actions, including calls to external contracts and calls to internal functions.

**PROPOSALS** relate membership and behavior; they are *objects* with which members can interact.

* If and when executed, they become actions of the DAO (via governance).

## Specification 

> The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).
The `DAO` contract storage contains `Policy`, `Proposals`, and `Config`.

### [Application Binary Interface](https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-contract/blob/main/sputnikdao2/ABI.md)
Several methods are provided, including:

```
{
  "viewMethods": [
    "get_config",
    "get_policy",
    "get_last_proposal_id",
    "get_proposals",
    "get_proposal",
  ],
  "changeMethods": [
    "new",
    "add_proposal",
    "act_proposal",
  ],
}
```

#### CORE DAO FUNCTIONALITY

* creating and managing:
  * **proposals**
  * **policies**
  * **members**
* processing **votes** and executing **decisions**
* updating the **state** of the DAO as a whole

### DAO Interface

```ts
/// For decentralized autonomous organizations.
type DAO = {
  config: Config,
  policy: Policy,
}
/******************/
/* CHANGE METHODS */
/******************/
/// add_proposal: submit a proposal to the DAO
///
/// Requirements
/// * Caller of the method must attach a deposit of 1 yoctoⓃ for security purposes.
/// * Calling the method fails in case of insufficient deposit.
/// * Only those with permission can add the proposal.
/// * The proposal is added to a list of proposals.
///
/// Arguments:
/// * `description`: context of the proposal
/// * `kind`: type of the proposal
function add_proposal(
    proposal: {
        description: String,
        kind: ProposalKind,
    },
): u64;
/// act_proposal: act on given proposal by id, if permissions allow
///
/// A successful workflow will end in a success execution outcome
/// to the callback on the DAO contract at the method `on_proposal_callback`.
///
/// Requirements:
/// * Caller of the method must attach a deposit of 1 yoctoⓃ for security purposes.
/// * Only those with permission can act on the the proposal.
///
/// Arguments:
/// * `id`: the ID of the proposal.
/// * `action`: the action with the proposal.
function act_proposal(
    id: u64,
    action: Action,
)
```

## Reference Implementation

### [Sputnik DAO](https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-contract)

The [contract](https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-contract/tree/main/sputnikdao2) and a [simple UI](https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-2-ui-reference) are available on GitHub.

> [V3: Sequoia Evergreen Release](https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-contract/releases/tag/3.0.0) ([changelog](https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-contract/compare/2.0.0...3.0.0))
Factory code: [sputnikdao-factory2/src](https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-contract/tree/main/sputnikdao-factory2/src)
* Mainnet: `sputnik-dao.near`
* Testnet: `sputnikv2.testnet`

DAO code: [sputnikdao2/src](https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-contract/tree/main/sputnikdao2)
* Mainnet: `<dao_name>.sputnik-dao.near`
* Testnet: `<dao_name>.sputnikv2.testnet`

View all DAOs by calling:

```
MAINNET
near view sputnik-dao.near get_dao_list
TESTNET
near view sputnikv2.testnet get_dao_list
```

Apps built on the Sputnik DAO contracts:

1. https://sputnik.fund --> V1 contracts
2. https://app.astrodao.com --> V2 and V3 contracts

> source code for the [Astro UI](https://github.com/near-daos/astro-ui) and [API Gateway](https://github.com/near-daos/astro-api-gateway)
## Future Possibilities 

We will explore ways to evolve this DAO contract to enable proposal-specific policies.

Also, developers can build clients or integrations extending Sputnik DAO capabilities.

### Governance Modules and Extensions:

* [DAO Composability](https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-contract/wiki/DAO-Composability#governance-module)
* [Module Composability UX](https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-contract/wiki/Module-Composability-UX)

*Please refer to the [Sputnik DAO Wiki](https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-contract/wiki/%5BDRAFT%5D-DAO-Data-Model-Architectures#module-examples) (on GitHub)*
